# 
# Challenges to address
# Location / environment based

## Storm drains
- Not at the bottom of a hill/next to water (contradicts the water turbine)
- need to check how the underground layers usually are laid out and how the water flows downhill. Construction may need to be like a "boat"

## Earthquake
- Not sure the build can do much about this --> avoid locations prone to it. I guess the UK is OK for that.

## Storm/tornado
Shouldn't be too much of a problem under earth.

# Build of the house
## Waterproof/damp proof
- maybe a container type, like the garden house (good isolation and watertight)

## Ventilation + filtration system
- Heat pump with filters to purify the air in addition to warming or cooling 

# Primary input and output
## Electricity generation
- Solar panels
- Water turbine from river
- Wind turbine
## Water production
- Filter river?
- Recycle grey water
## Sewage system

# Secondary 

## Heating / cooling 
Via the ventilation system 
## Heating water

## Access
How to get inside in a safe way depending on the weather?

## Oxygen/CO2 levels + emergency alarm?
ie. what if the vent for the Aircon gets stuck and CO2 level raises.
What do they do in a submarine?
